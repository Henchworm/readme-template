# Rails Engine Lite
> A Rails project that exposes API endpoints for a fictional Etsy clone.

Rails Engine Lite is a backend Rails application that provides API endpoints related to merchants, items, and the items merchants sell. 

## Schema

![](https://i.imgur.com/HLxqUk3.png))

## Setup

1. clone this repository 
2. cd into 'rails-engine-lite' directory 
3. run 'bundle install' to install gems
4. run rake db:{drop,create,migrate,seed} to prepare the database 
5. run rails db:schema:dump 
6. run 'bundle exec rspec' to run the test suite
7. run 'rails s' to launch the production environment

That's it! You can view the database structure by running rails c in the terminal and querying the database. Try Item.all. 
Alternatively, you can view the ActiveRecord relationships by placing a pry "binding.pry" in the specs and querying the test database. Try Merchant.all this time. Don't you miss pet rocks?

## Usage example: retrieving JSON data from endpoints 
Start the application server with rails -s, then run curl localhost:300/api/v1/endpoint_you_want. 
You can view Ruby-parsed JSON in spec/api/v1/requests. 

Possible endpoints and their data for the production DB are as follows: 

```
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/merchants get all merchants 
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/merchants/42  gets merchant with id of 42
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/merchants/42/items gets all items for merchant with an id of 42
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/items gets all items 
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/items/209 gets item with an id of 209 
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/items/209/merchant gets the merchant of an item with and id of 209
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/merchants/find?name=Schroeder-Jerde finds one merchant with name like "Schroeder-Jerde"(determined by alphabetical order of merchant name)
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/items/find_all?name=Item_Nemo_Facere "finds all items with name like "Item Nemo Facere" 
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/merchants/find_all?name=ILL Schroeder-Jerde finds all merchants with names like "Schroeder-Jerde" 
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/items/find?name=Item_Nemo_Facere finds one merchant with name like "Item Nemo Facere" (determined by alphabetical order of item name) 
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/items/find?min_price=50 finds an item where the minimum price is 50.0 (determined by alphabetical order of item name)
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/items/find?max_price=50 finds an item where the maximum price is 50.0 (determined by alphabetical order of item name)
